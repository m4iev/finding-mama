# Finding Mama

"Finding Mama" is a 2D adventure game created with Unity Engine. It's about a young child on a quest to find her mother, exploring various scenes and interacting with the environment. The story is kinda absurd and trash, but this is one of the early projects that I made when i learn Unity.

## Story

The game begins with a simple, yet powerful premise: a child named Aisha is looking for her mother. The player must navigate through a building with 3 floors. Along the way, you'll encounter different characters that will try to stop you by giving some questions to make sure you are allowed to go.

## How to Play

The controls are simple and intuitive:

- Arrow Keys (Left, Right): Move your character.
- Mouse

The objective is to explore each area thoroughly, talk to everyone you meet, and answer the questions to progress through the story and ultimately find your mother.
